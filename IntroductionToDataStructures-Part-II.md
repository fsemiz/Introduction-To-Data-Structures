### Hash Tables
    Hash Table: A data structure that implements a type of array that can map keys to values.  It uses a hash function to compute an index, into an array of slots, from which the desired value can be found.
Many applications require a dictionary like data structure which supports only the dictionary operations INSERT, SEARCH, and DELETE. Creating a specisific data structure for these kind of operations can speed up the algorithms a lot.

Actually the example shown is an example of an direct access table.
