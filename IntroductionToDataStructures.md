### Introduction

**DevOps** is short for **Dev**elopment and **Op**eration**s**.
It concentrates on collaboration between developers and other parties involved in building, deploying, operating, and maintaining software systems.

DevOps is a software engineering culture that unites the development and operations team under an umbrella of tools to automate every stage.

**DevOps is a set of cultural norms and technical practices that enable this fast flow of work from dev through test through operations while preserving world class reliability.** - Gene Kim

**DevOps blends lean thinking with agile philosophy.**
